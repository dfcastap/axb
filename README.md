# axb
Various expressions of Ax = b, or Gm = d if you prefer

Trying to make a basic, instructive version of [Mauricio Sacchi's tutorial](https://www.ualberta.ca/~msacchi/GEOPH431_531/linear_intro.pdf) in various languages:

- MATLAB — the original version
- [Python NumPy](NumPy.ipynb) — finished, more or less
- [Julia](Julia.ipynb) — started
- [Lua Torch](Torch.ipynb) — finished, more or less
- [R](R.ipynb) — I need help on this
- [NumericJS](NumericJS.ipynb) — possibly ill-advised :)

The idea is to use the fundamentals of linear algebra (dot products, inverses, etc), rather than high-level functions. But where those high-level solving functions exist, we should mention and illustrate them too.

The ones that say 'finished' can certainly be improved upon!
