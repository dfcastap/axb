# axb
Various expressions of Ax = b, or Gm = d if you prefer

Trying to make a basic, instructive version of [Mauricio Sacchi's tutorial](https://www.ualberta.ca/~msacchi/GEOPH431_531/linear_intro.pdf) in various languages:

- MATLAB (the original version)
- Python NumPy
- Julia
- Lua Torch
- R

The idea is to use the fundamentals of linear algebra (dot products, inverses, etc), rather than high-level functions. But where those high-level solving functions exist, we should mention and illustrate them too.
